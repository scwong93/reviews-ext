# Reviews Extension
Amazon is filled with fake and biased reviews due to the seller's marketing tactics to boost sales. Reviews Extension is a Chrome plugin used to view additional reviews with the click of a button from third party retailers (Walmart) for Amazon products. Simply and easy to use, start shopping with REAL reviews.
